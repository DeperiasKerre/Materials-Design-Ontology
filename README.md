### What is Materials Design Ontology?

MDO is an ontology for materials design field, representing the domain knowledge specifically related to solid-state physics and computational materials science.

### What does Materials Design Ontology consist of?

Materials Design Ontology consists of 4 modules which are:

* [Core](https://w3id.org/mdo/core/1.0): This module consists of the top-level concepts and relationships of the materials design ontology, which are also reused in other modules.

* [Structure](https://w3id.org/mdo/structure/1.0): The structure module is intended to represent the structural information of materials. Such structural information is also the basis of materials calculations.

* [Calculation](https://w3id.org/mdo/calculation/1.0): This module is intended to represent the classification of different computational methods.

* [Provenance](https://w3id.org/mdo/provenance/1.0): This module is intended to represent the provenance information of materials data and calculation.

* A full MDO importing all the above modules is avaliable at [MDO Full](https://w3id.org/mdo/full/1.0).
